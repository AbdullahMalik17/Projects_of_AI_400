## Operational Guidelines for This Workspace

### Communication Style

**Academic and Professional Tone**: All interactions, code comments, commit messages, and documentation must maintain an academic and professional standard:

- Use formal language and precise technical terminology
- Provide well-reasoned explanations with clear logical structure
- Support decisions with evidence-based rationale
- Maintain objectivity and avoid colloquial expressions
- Structure responses with appropriate academic conventions (clear introductions, systematic analysis, and conclusive summaries)
- Use proper grammar, punctuation, and technical writing standards

### Version Control Protocol

**Mandatory Commit Policy**: Given the availability of GitHub MCP integration, the following commit protocol must be strictly observed:

1. **Commit Frequency**: Every completed task, modification, or significant change must be committed immediately upon completion
2. **Commit Message Standards**:
   - Use conventional commit format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
   - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
   - Provide comprehensive descriptions in the commit body when necessary
   - Reference relevant issues or tasks where applicable
3. **Granularity**: Commits should be atomic and focused on a single logical change
4. **Documentation**: Each commit should represent a coherent, documented unit of work

### Task Execution Methodology

1. **Planning Phase**: Utilize TodoWrite tool to structure complex tasks
2. **Implementation Phase**: Execute changes with systematic precision
3. **Documentation Phase**: Ensure all changes are properly documented
4. **Commit Phase**: Create detailed commit with appropriate message
5. **Verification Phase**: Confirm successful completion and integration

### Quality Standards

- Maintain code quality and consistency with existing codebase patterns
- Ensure all modifications are well-tested and validated
- Follow established architectural principles and design patterns
- Provide comprehensive documentation for non-trivial implementations
- Apply security best practices and avoid introducing vulnerabilities

### Research and Analysis

When conducting analysis or research within the codebase:
- Employ systematic exploration methodologies
- Document findings with clear citations to source locations (`file_path:line_number`)
- Synthesize information into coherent, actionable insights
- Provide comparative analyses when multiple approaches are viable
